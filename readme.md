## What is AIEditor

AiEditor is a next-generation rich text editor for AI. It is based on Web Component and supports almost any front-end framework such as Vue, React, Angular, etc. It is compatible with PC Web
and mobiles, and provides two themes: light and dark. In addition, it also provides flexible configuration, and developers can easily use it to develop any text editing application.

For more information about AiEditor, please visit the official website: https://aieditor.dev


## What makes AIEditor different

### 1. AI-Powered editor
The goal of AIEditor is to create a rich text editor that is completely driven by AI, and supports docking with any large model, including private large models. Allow users to use their own private large model ApiKey.
Not only that, all AI functions of AIEditor allow users to customize their own prompts and extended AI menus.

### 2. Simple, friendly, and easy to use

AIEditor is developed based on Web Component and supports integration with any mainstream front-end framework. AIEditor uses the more friendly LGPL open source protocol and is used through `npm i aieditor`,
without worrying about the GPL infection problem that may be caused by the GPL protocol.

### 3. In addition to the open source version, a commercial version is also available
In addition to the open source version, we also provide a more powerful commercial version, which does not limit the number of users or the number of applications. For more comparisons of commercial versions,
